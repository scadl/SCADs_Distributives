# SCADs_Distributives a.k.a. dDB
Is pretty straight app, able to cache your CSV tables as internal sqlite db, which, in tturn, allow to quickly search throught it's first column, and see reaults, together with associated second column values. 

This app not really useful as itself, thought it's fully functional. It is more intended to be used as learning materaial for android development technics, than to be used as small production app.
